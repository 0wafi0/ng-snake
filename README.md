## Background

While working in Consumer Integrated Mental Health Application (CIMHA) under queensland health, a fair portions of the angular stack where utilizing rxjs. Due to tight deadlines, I mostly followed what more senior developers applied and implemented without actually taking a step back to understand it. This snake game with angular and rxjs aims to help me grasp that. Further more I've learnt and investigated various quirks of JavaScript and practiced functional programming.
